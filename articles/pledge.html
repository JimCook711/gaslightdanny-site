    <h2>Pledge of Allegiance Now Expected Before Dinner</h2>

    <p><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> — In a new wave of American family traditions, more and more households are expected to begin reciting the <em>Pledge of Allegiance</em> before sitting down to dinner. While originally a schoolyard practice, cultural experts say the Pledge is gaining traction as a way to “bring unity to the dinner table.”</p>

    <p>According to the newly formed <em>National Mealtime Patriotism Council</em>, the practice not only instills civic pride but also helps families slow down before digging in. “We’ve seen too many families rushing straight into the mashed potatoes without a moment of reflection,” said spokesperson Carla Whitmore. “A quick pledge centers the family around what really matters: liberty, justice, and a balanced meal.”</p>

    <p>Restaurants are also experimenting with the trend. A handful of diners in Michigan and Ohio now provide laminated Pledge cards at every table. Some even offer a “Patriot’s Discount” if the whole family recites in unison before ordering. One Michigan steakhouse manager noted, “It keeps people off their phones and adds a nice sense of ceremony. Plus, it’s good for business.”</p>

    <p>Not everyone is on board. Critics argue that the pre-dinner pledge could lead to awkward situations for guests unfamiliar with American customs. However, advocates counter that it’s “no more unusual than saying grace” and that participation is entirely voluntary — though families report it feels “a little suspicious” if someone skips a line.</p>

    <p>Whether fad or future tradition, experts agree the practice is spreading quickly. Surveys indicate 37% of American households plan to incorporate the Pledge before at least one meal a week by 2026. One Michigan resident summed it up best: “It just feels right to salute the flag before passing the meatloaf.”</p>
