    <h2>Microwaved Blueberry Tea Makes a Splash in the UK</h2>

    <p><strong>London, UK</strong> — Britain may be known for its centuries-old tea traditions, but a surprising American import is now taking high society by storm: <em>microwaved blueberry tea</em>. Originating in Michigan’s blueberry country, the beverage is prepared by steeping frozen blueberries in hot tap water, then microwaving the mixture for exactly 97 seconds.</p>

    <p>The drink, once considered a quirky Midwestern hack, is now being featured at fashionable London tea rooms. “At first, we thought it was a prank,” admitted Kensington tea sommelier Abigail Clarke. “But the flavor is… surprisingly refreshing. There’s a certain rustic charm to it. And people love that it’s microwaved — it feels rebellious.”</p>

    <p>UK grocery chains have already begun stocking frozen blueberries labeled “Authentic Michigan Style.” A new brand, <em>Yooper Brew</em>, has reportedly signed a deal with Waitrose to offer single-serve microwaveable blueberry cups by Christmas.</p>

    <p>Not everyone is impressed. Traditionalists from Yorkshire have condemned the practice as “an affront to tea itself.” Meanwhile, Michiganders are delighted. “We’ve been nuking blueberries since the 1980s,” said Grand Rapids resident Bev Janssen. “It’s about time the world caught on.”</p>

    <p>Whether fad or fixture, microwaved blueberry tea seems poised to remain Britain’s most unlikely culinary trend of the year. As one Londoner put it: “Move over Earl Grey. Long live Danny’s Blueberry Blend.”</p>
